Hello, and welcome, to Ryu64!  This emulator aims to emulate the Nintendo 64, don't expect much right now, no commercial games work at the time of writing this.  But hopefully, that is soon to change, if you want to help just make a PR, we'll be glad to accept improvements to the emulator.

## FAQ
### Why make another Nintendo 64 Emulator?
Why not?  I have a passion for emulation, and a good way to express that is to make an emulator.  The choice in the Nintendo 64 is just because the Console is very interesting in the way it works.
### What does the name "Ryu64" derive from?
Simply put, the name just comes from the RyuJIT which is what .NET uses to run applications built in both Visual Basic and C#, we use the latter.
### Is there anywhere I can see your guys work on the emulator, and communicate, all in real time?
There is!  We have a discord where all the developers hang out, talk about development, etc.  [Join here.](https://discord.gg/KPQh9UY)
### Do you have a website with more information?
[We do!](https://ryu64emulator.github.io/Ryu64Website/index.html)
